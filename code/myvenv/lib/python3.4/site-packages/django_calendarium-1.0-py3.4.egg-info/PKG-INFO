Description: Django Calendarium
        ==================
        
        A Django application for managing and displaying a calendar and it's events
        in your templates.
        
        It will be heavily influenced by the awesome
        `django-schedule <https://github.com/thauber/django-schedule>`_
        
        Since that project is unfortunately no longer maintained, we will try to revive
        it's ideas with TDD, class based views and AJAX in mind.
        
        For further information, please check out the
        `django-calendarium documentation <https://django-calendarium.readthedocs.org/>`_
        on readthedocs.

        We added some basic bootstrap styles to start with. If you're not using
        Bootstrap we recommend to build your own styles, otherwise try:
        
            {% load static %}
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "calendarium/css/bootstrap.min.css" %}">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "calendarium/css/calendar.css" %}">
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        If you want your calendar to start on a different date, you can set the
        ``CALENDARIUM_SHIFT_WEEKSTART`` setting to be the offset in days, that the
        calendar should add or subtract from the start day of the week. Most common
        case is probably, that you want your calendar week to start on sunday in which
        case you would add the following to your settings::
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            CALENDARIUM_SHIFT_WEEKSTART = -1
        
        
        Extending the app
        -----------------
        
        It is almost inevitable that you will want to add more fields or more
        functionality to the Event model of this app. However, this app is already
        quite complex and we would like to keep it as simple and focused as possible.
        This app should do one thing and do it well, and that thing is: to output
        (recurring) events for a given day, week, month or timeframe.
        
        A very common usecase is to display public events that are open for
        registration. For this case we have created another app `django-event-rsvp
        <https://github.com/bitmazk/django-event-rsvp>`_ which plays nicely with this
        app.
        
        You might do it in a similar way. Since events created in the calendarium app
        can easily be tied to any object via generic foreign keys, you can therefore
        tie them to the objects of any of your own apps. The only thing left for you is
        to create nice CRUD views that create your own objects and our Event objects
        simultaneously behind the scenes.
